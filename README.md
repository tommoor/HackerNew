## Features

* Improved readability design
* User following
* Retina screen support
* Quick inline replies
* Quick profiles with social network info when hovering over usernames

## Development

This code is old, it's not good, there are jQuery selectors all over the place and
It's probably best rebuilt from scratch. You've been warned :)
